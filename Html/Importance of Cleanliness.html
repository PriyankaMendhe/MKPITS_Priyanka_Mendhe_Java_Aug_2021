    The importance of cleanliness in our lives cannot be denied. Maintaining a clean environment is for the health of all humans, as their health  completely </p>
    completely depends on the atmosphere. A bad environment is solely responsible for spoiling the health of the people around. Dirt and disease go together.</p>
    Cleanliness is a very essential component of human life in both physical and spiritual terms. Spiritual cleanliness refers to following the beliefs and</p>
    rituals of your religion. On the other hand, the physical one is essential for the well-being of and existence of humanity.</p>
